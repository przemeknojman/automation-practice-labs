# Professional First Test

This lab accompanies the video:

How to write your first professional Playwright test with TypeScript (2026 approach)
YouTube link: https://youtube.com/...

## Goal of this lab

The goal of this lab is **not** to practice Playwright syntax.

The goal is to understand **what a professional automated test actually is**:

- a test is **not a script**
- a test expresses **business intent**
- implementation details belong **outside** the test
- the test should be readable even by non-automation people

This lab provides a **simple login → dashboard scenario** that you can use
to practice writing tests that focus on **intent**, not UI mechanics.
